# Basic Linux setup scripts

These scripts are a WORK IN PROGRESS, easy way to set up Linux Distributions with software and settings preferable to myself, and most users.

## Usage:

Clone this git repository, cd into it, then run `sudo bash ./'name-of'distro'`

### Automatic Mode

Automatic mode will (atempt to) run everything automatically. After this mode is selected, it will ask if you want to change your devices Hostname. After this prompt is completed, you may leave the script unattended.

### Manual Mode

Manuel mode will require you to select if you want each segment of the script to run, and verify if you would like to run parts of those segments (ex. each package will ask if you would like to install it or not).
Manuel Mode will walk you through how to use it, just follow the prompts.
